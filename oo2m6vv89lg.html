<div>      Hydrochemistry has been used to differentiate water samples based on their hydrogeological system. However, we would still need data visualizations to identify the similarity as well as the dissimilarity between samples. Many analysts are familiar with worksheet-based application, yet its ability to visualize data&nbsp;is fairly limited. In this paper we're going to introduce R statistical program to help us distinguish groundwater samples. Data were taken from several locations (from spring and dug well): 10 samples from volcanic system&nbsp; (two from&nbsp;Pangalengan and eight from Greater Bandung), five data from limestone area of Padaralang, and five from coastal alluvium area of  Indramayu.&nbsp;Physical properties such as elevation, temperature, pH, electro-conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured using portable tools, whilst hardness, major elements, Fe, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub> were measured in the lab. In the visualizations, we recommend a simple strip-chart from R. Code and data will be made publicly available upon the acceptance of this abstract to ensure its reproducibility.Our visualizations show a straightforward differentiation based on EC/TDS, hardness, Ca, Na, K, and HCO<sub>3</sub>. EC/TDS are related to the distance from recharge area and rain water. Hardness is connected to Ca dan HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration, and it also resembles the ion exchange processes in the aquifer. HCO<sub>3</sub>, aside to only derived from carbon cycle, it could also come from rain water and probably geothermal domain gasses (especially for volcanic samples). Interestingly all samples contain NO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>3</sub>, and NH<sub>4</sub>, for which it could indicate water contamination from waste. This method seems to be working with its viability is subjected to the number of samples and additional data for  comparison. This is where open data is important for researcher. We also recommend R for its robust visualization.</div>
