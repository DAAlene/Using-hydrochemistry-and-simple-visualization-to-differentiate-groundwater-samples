<div>Our visualizations show a straightforward differentiation based on EC/TDS, hardness, Ca, Na, K, and HCO<sub>3</sub>. EC/TDS are related to the distance from recharge area and rain water. Hardness is connected to Ca dan HCO3 concentration, and it also resembles the ion exchange processes in the aquifer. HCO3, aside to only derived from carbon cycle, it could also come from rain water and probably geothermal domain gasses (especially for volcanic samples). Interestingly all samples contain NO2, NO3, and NH4, for which it could indicate water contamination from waste. This method seems to be working with its viability is subjected to the number of samples and additional data for  comparison purposes. This is where open data should be&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
