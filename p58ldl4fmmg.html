<div>Our visualizations show a straightforward differentiation based on EC/TDS, hardness, Ca, Na, K, and HCO<sub>3</sub>. EC/TDS are related to the distance from recharge area and rain water. Hardness is connected to Ca dan HCO3 concentration, and it also resembles the ion exchange processes in the aquifer. HCO3, aside to only derived from carbon cycle, it could also come from rain water and probably geothermal-bound air hujan dan mungkin gas sistem geotermal, khususnya pada sampel air dari kawasan gunungapi.</div>
