However, we would still need data visualizations to identify the similarity as well as the dissimilarity between samples. Many analysts are familiar with worksheet-based application, yet its ability to visualize data&nbsp;is fairly limited. In this paper we're going to introduce R statistical program to help us distinguish groundwater samples.</div><div></div><div>Data were taken from several locations (from spring and dug well): 10 samples from volcanic system&nbsp; (two from&nbsp;Pangalengan and eight from Greater Bandung), five data from limestone area of Padaralang, and five from coastal alluvium area of  Indramayu.&nbsp;Physical properties such as elevation, temperature, pH, electro-conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured using portable tools, whilst hardness, major elements, Fe, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub> were measured in the lab. In the visualizations, we recommend a simple strip-chart from R. Code and data will be made publicly available upon the acceptance of this abstract to ensure its reproducibility. &nbsp;</div>
